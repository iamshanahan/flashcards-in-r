# Motivation
1. I had a small c++ flashcard program at one time.  I miss it!
2. Memorization is fun.
3. Since I am a math major and software engineer who loves statistics, it seemed like a shame that I didn't know R.  It's a pirate's favorite language!
4. I like the idea of using computers to make you better at something rather than doing something for you so that you forget how to do it.
